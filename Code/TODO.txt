Term Project (EECS 573)
-----------------------

Aim
===
This project aims to create a Natural Language Model such as to extract
information from processor errata documents published by ARM and Intel. Due to
dearth of information from Intel, we'll be focusing initially on ARM.

Roadmap
=======
The first step is to extract structured data from the PDFs. Unfortunately due to
differences in document structures, this laborious task will have to be done by
hand. A csv file containing the structured data will be created as the end
result of this data extraction effort.

Once data + metadata has been extracted, the next step is to generate a NL model
which supports inferencing.
